# Sea Defence - Working with Drones

It is time for European countries to prepare themselves for the coming war.

We are discussing the sea domain.
They use sea drones. They work entirely with unmapped systems and capabilities.

They use the Kraken drone from Kraken technologies.
Getting water defence of Odessa is important. You want to avoid damage to the city itself

FPVs are cheap, the bomber is expensive.

Can help with navigation.
If you don't have GPS, you might use Russian EW.
People spent time calculating their route by the stars. Using navigation software and pictures of the stars

[Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(situational_awareness_system)) - a map with layers used by 99% of units in Ukraine. Very widely used software
Plugins. Basically a gigantic database
There is also a streaming platform which lets you see everything going on in the frontline.

[Magura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAGURA_V5) - sea-based drones. They will do reconnaissance, patrolling, logistics, anti-ship, anti-air, and unmanned delivery.

Questions:

There are automatic plugins. You can mark on a map on a video where you want some drone to attack, and it will go off and do that
This is used for collecting data to show the operator. This was you can always view what is going on and access the chain of command

Delta has the concept of a data layer. This lets you put the targets you are going for, and you can share it with your unit. This can then have real-time streaming

You need people to service these boats.
There is a US company which is proposing having a swarm of drones which can go out and pilot things together. The integration process is annoying and difficult

For one of their weapons given they weren't trained. So there were photos in a newspaper explaining how to use it
As soon as it's working they start to use it

They have an algorithm for working out how the artillery is working. It is very difficult to strike with FPV

Industry is helping them use small radars to detect targets in the sea.
They want to have early awareness of enemy boats
Orion - reconnaissance drone which is always in the air.
If there are bad weather conditions and they can't see drones they are more vulnerable

Optical fibre drones. They were late. Russians invested this system, and the Ukrainians didn't believe in the technology and didn't pick it up fast enough
Optical fibre drones are really important for morale. This is because you cannot use EW (electronic warfare) to secure somewhere
Optical fibre is probably $500 extra. It can also carry less. Less effective, but needed for EW protection and was a game changed for troop morale as it means that you are never properly protected

Ukrainian company [Swarmer](https://www.getswarmer.com/) is there to make fully autonomous drones.
They have the issue that it is one operator per drone, both for air and for sea drones.
The lack of operators is a meaningful constraint.
Starlink has its own positioning

You have to move around areas of EW denial. Then they destroy the boat if you cannot get to the target

Starlink was a game changer. 98% of all communications go through it. All the boats use starlink
It is critical for them
RadioNora from Norway only for ground

TradeOne - hundreds of producers getting stuff together. In Ukraine there isn't much of an army civilian distinction as the war is so much of people's lives.

Ukrainians are really fast due to need.

The units themselves have their own budgets. They will have their own R&D and production workshops.
The units used to just be given stuff by the minister of defence. But now they can do things kind of autonomously
Old methods of procurement don't work, as you need to move fast

Majority of parts for FPV come from China
They are making their own motors, cameras, but a lot of things like magnets come from China
The end users i.e. the units write a request to the minister for things. The end users know what they need
Usually the users work with producers, but then they arrange financing from another government.
Nets are being used to stop sea drones. Like to protect bridges, they take old boats and put nets between them.
