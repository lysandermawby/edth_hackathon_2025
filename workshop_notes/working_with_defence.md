# Working with Defence

Workshop.

Notes from a former royal marine on working with defence as a startup.

Currently working with Kraken Technologies Group.
He's been the guy on the inside and is now actively trying to sell into defence.

Very large amounts of private capital and energy going into European sovereignty.
Largely pushed forwards by the European signal-gate, with Pete Hegseth clearly complaining about European capabilities.
Russian incursions into European airspace is kicking things off.
There also isn't the money to make this sort of thing work. European sovereign capabilities are being built up and so we. need to have our own supply chains.

Reputation is incredibly important. You cannot afford to annoy people. If you aren't bad, you'll do very well

General problem for the navy. They don't know how to have broad awareness of what is going on with on and below the water surveillance across a wide area.
For acute stuff, there is generally knowledge of what you ned and you'll go off and find stuff. This stuff is generally only accessibly but having a network and being ale to deliver fast.

Single-source is ideal. But this is general only for a small number of systems
This is generally by informal networks. Texting people, asking them about stuff. For discovery, you need to be advertising your stuff to DSTL.
There are general competitions for bringing stuff in

Primes and SMEs. Primes get really bad reputations. They will sometimes be able to come along and remove a bunch of risk. They will do things like do risk assessments for you
It is really bad if you buy something, it doesn't work, and this is really bad.

We are going to be building E, but defence wants all of these

Babcock - if you're partnered with them you will generally not be able to speak with the end customer
As a startup, fight aggressively to be with the end user.

Understand the budget cycles and the underspends
They live on the financial year
The underspends come in around Christmas
If you head someone mention that they might have an underspend, make sure you can come in and make their life easy

Understand the distinction between operators and desk officers
operator is actually using the thing. sometimes you can get someone who really likes your thing and will get it through
desk officers are highly risk averse. they will not want to push things through, want a lot of things signed off, and will generally slow stuff down

If you're going for an underspend, the kit needs to be delivered before the end of the financial year

Build to the finish - find, fix, finish. Finish is the most important part. This is people who are putting themselves at risk. 
Get your stuff into the real world as often and as quickly as you can
TRL - this is useful for getting people to buy stuff. But. the user probably doesn't care
Be clear with what your thing does, and make it easy to demonstrate and easy to buy
Help with adoption - the training, risks, policies, and after sales stuff is really important
network with operators. make sure you understand the users and what they are really doing
hire the right veterans. you want to hire people who are network into the appropriate area. test their knowledge of your domain

Most important is that you should build for the finish.

Big difference between US and European procurement is that US budgetry cycles are really long (3-4 years) which makes everything slowed
UK procurement is just faster.
US has the concept of a valley of death

Chinese internet connections means that you probably cannot sell a part into Western militaries
Some drones have in the firmware that they are sending all of the data back to china

No-one can do at sea autonomous collision avoidance

Anduril gave Altius munitions that didn't work - killed their own reputation

Counter-UAS stuff. You will need to make sure you go on the site and make sure that your tech is being built properly
