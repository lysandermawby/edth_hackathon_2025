Tacking Quantum-6 (and Stark-1 to a degree). We aim to:
1) Identify objects in video in real time
2) Find their velocity, acceleration, and object type
3) Create a live map of objects of interest and where previously identified objects are likely to be
4) Recognise when a previously identified object has entered the scene
