# Air Defence on a Tactical Level

Notes from workshop.

Short presentation, including what is the biggest threat for 0 to 50km on the frontline (shaheds, loitering munition, fixed wing FPV, recon drones, FPV copters), what are the main methods for countering these UAVs + long Q&A.

Presented by a delegation of Ukrainian soldiers.

----

There are around 180km of the frontline.
They fight from frontline to 50km back into the country.
Echeloned air defence refers to the distinctions between different levels of air defence made available.

Army corps are linear groups formations. Front line of defence. First to encounter soldiers and air attacks.
Russia has scale advantage.

First echelon is being breached. Mass UAVs breach the first ine of defence. Too expensive to destroy UAVs with rockets.
Cannot be at readiness al of the time. THe drones floy 24/7. THey fly high ostthat the air defence like shotguns and machien funs cannont each them. SO they can use them all ady and all nice.
3-D radrar stations. This isthe first echelon. THey can see where the target is andthe angle. An exact 3-D image of wheer the done is. Fror their UAVs, thye need ot know the eaxact height of the drones.
FOr now, their UAVs cannot reach the enemy isile.s THe ricoekrs fly too high.

If they an destroy enemy UAVs with their own UAVs,then they can save the SMAs and the rockets of rother rtargets.

First echelon uses short range radar stations to fine and strike UVs.
Should be build across the entire frontline
They put a warhead on the drone and us it for delivery

robin - make the spmall radars
It can see 3-5km infront. Their artillery might want in a forest. Thanks for this drone, hthen know when a striking drone in coming. THey can destroy in aadvance

They use ordianry 10 inch digital fpv drone iwht a warhead on it.
Once they know an enemy mavrick above them, they destroy is using the warhead on an FPV
mavick cost 1.5k dollar, and the FPV costs 900 sollar
Really had to shoot the drones. The drdrones contillually moe
LIDAR is used tot tryt shoot the mavick
They ahe shotguns on the drones

Second ecelon of air defence - 5-15kn from the front line. These drones that they use there might fly 2-5 km high
Drones fly too high here to efectively get and stop hem

Third echelon - 15-50 km .Very much defendign logistics
They are notj just highing in the forests and the fields but also cities
They mostly have RADAR - isaeli
This one can do up to 40km. They can see a lot ahead - this can see wing type drones. Designed to see bigger drones.
Shahed - 100 shahed per square km. All echelos are important
Not just fixe drones but they also use fixed wing drones because the shahed it much faster than other kinds
these dones can do 200-250 km/h. Some drones can do up to 600km/h, but cannot fly so far

They have all intereptors on hte same principal
The radar can see osmething
the operator of the radar says that they see one
the operator of the drone flys them
by hands or by computer, it finds the enemy drone using optical sensor (digital camera, thermal, all done by something optical)
big question is what can you do if there are bad optical conditions
they don't currently have something which can handle bad optical conditions
putting acoustic sensors on the drone might allow this to work
can also use small radars. somethign which cn see 500m away, you can still attack the other drone

all provoctions begin with air
wars begin with air

electronic warfare is down. that means that you cnanot drie properly
starlink is widely used

------

skymapper - a lot of things which take informaiton form the radars and put it into a single map
That way drone operators can design waht they are targetting
one group might be there for the interceptor, another team might e in charge ofthe rockets like the stingers

we can give him microphones which he can stream back data from
the echelon radars - the first ones are about $20k (the smallest one). The second echelon is very important, $400k. the radar at the third echelon is around $500k .

In an ideal world, 180km across and 50km back they have one radio locational field 
that way the shahed could be moved easily
in reality the radar tuff moves every day. this makes it harder to get stuff

2D radars can see much further but dont know the height
interceptor drone must last around 15minutes
this is at cruise speed which is around wing type drones
much better ofr fight shahed drones with wing type drones because you can make a swarm iwth the drones

Anduril - lattice software.
they have systems wchih, once hthey lock onto a shahed thermal signal like the engine, you press something nad theddrone autoamtically pilots nd hits the other drone
but they don't have enough like this
they have automatical loitering - this is where the drone just goes in the some circle
the AI drones fail to do anything if the drone isn't in line of sight

terminal guidance - they have some stuff where the last bit of hte approach isn't very good
it is a pixel fix sometimes
once the drone is out of the field of view, the drone doesn't effectively follow it

they test drones on the front line
a shahed that can fly at 200km/h they cost $100k
for an interceptor you can get some which are from $5-10k

the drone operator sees the radar operator screen
the drones are seen approaching each other on the radar
then in the terminal stage optical sensors are used and an operator manually hits it

skymapper, groundcontrol, greshit (some system?), they all talk to radars but they are different systems and are used by different teams

from smallest to biggest
- good lidar - really important
- all weather condition sensor - somethig nwhich can work in bad optimcal conditions
- some drone with machine guns, and make it something such that the drone can shoot down a shahed without losing the drone itself (also a UAV which can strike shaheds on one flight, or an entirely autonomous one reducing the number of operators you need)

latency must be below one second

will need to detect from 500m
scale of production
